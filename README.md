Personal Crypto Currency Portfolio and Calculator

Description: This project allows you to register an account, log in to your account, and access a crypto calculator. Once you login, you
can either go to the calculator or go to a personal portfolio of crypto currencies that you have added to your file.

Purpose: I created this as a personal project because I always find it a hassle to go on multiple websites to find my total amount ivnested.

Dependancies: An IDE that runs java programs, mysql-connector-java-8.0.17, and jsoup library

Usage: You can use is it as a real time crypto calculator and a real portfolio crypto calculator

Future work: There is a lot of potential areas to upgrade in the future. The look of the application can be greatly improved on, I can
turn it into an android app, and add some more buttons for better functionality and frame navigation.

This project is related to my course work because I have done classes in java and databse creation and manipulation.
